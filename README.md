# flex-box

The Flexbox Layout officially called CSS Flexible Box Layout Module is new layout module in CSS3 made to improve the
items align, directions and order in the container even when they are with dynamic or even unknown size. The prime
characteristic of the flex container is the ability to modify the width or height of its children to fill the available
space in the best possible way on different screen sizes.

Flexbox is similar to the block layout, except that it lacks many of the properties that can be used in a block layout,
such as floats and columns. But then again it has more flexibility for distributing space and aligning content in ways
that web applications and complex web pages often need. It solves many other layout problems that we have been fighting
against and trying to solve for a very long time—such as vertical centering, for example, among many others.

Flexbox allows you to lay out elements in a container, arrange and (re)order them, align them, and distribute the space
between (and/or around) them, regardless of their size. It allows you to make them literally flexible—items inside a
container can be stretched and shrunk to accommodate the available space, and can be sized in proportionally to each
other, and any available space between or around them can be distributed among them based on a proportion that you get
to specify.

Using flexbox, you can also lay elements out inside a container in either directions: horizontal or vertical, called the
flex directions; you’re not bound to just one direction as in other layout modes. This allows for the creation of more
adaptive and responsive layouts that adapt to the layout changes on different screen sizes and orientations.
